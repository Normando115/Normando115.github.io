    <h1>
      <p> My name is Norman Zhao and I am a Digital Media Major at San Jose State University. My goal in DMA is to be able to use my skill set in drawing and coding to create artworks that align with things that I care about which include video games, animation, and turtles. Since I was a kid, I have been in love with games and anime and that has pushed me forward in terms of what I had wanted to become when it came to careers. Initially I was planning to become a computer programmer, but after pursuing computer science for a year, I discovered that it is not something I was able to comprehend and that my artistic skills were not being used to its fullest potential. Coding is still something that I have interest in and is something I am learning slowly, but my main pursuit is digital drawing. </p>

      <p> For me, video games are not just entertainment, but a way of life as it is something I grew up with and through video games I found many of my friends and became a home for me with how comfortable I am being myself in video games. It is the same with animation as I have always watched animations and was always intrigued with how pictures can become episodes and how detailed and cool all the shows were. Because of the impact video games had on me, I wanted others to experience how I felt when playing games and so I felt the easiest way was to make a game that will become a place people can call home. <p>
<p>  Because of my love for video games and animation, I wanted to do something that had something to do with video games or animations which is why I believe that digital media art aligns with my interests the most because it doesnâ€™t focus on just digital art or coding, but is a mix of both mediums which allows me to do not have to abandon a passion.
</p>

<p> What inspired me to become an artist is my love for manga as a kid and that became my driving force to become a better artist as I develop and hone my art skills.
Besides my love for manga,anime and video games, a content creator named 39Daph is my main inspiration for art as her art is focused towards the gaming and manga/anime community and she does it while not caring about how people feel about her artwork or who she is as an artist and is what I aim for when it comes to art. Her work has inspired me to find my own style and to continue on the path I am walking and someday I will reach my goal as long as I never stop trying.
