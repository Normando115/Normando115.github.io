     Title: The Turtle Exterminator
    Medium: Adobe Illustrator
    Dimensions: 533x354 pixels 
    <h2> I had a lot of fun designing this character as I was making it with the intention of animating him in the future. I got the idea to draw a turtle hating turtle from watching my favorite youtuber, Michael Reeves, who is a turtle hater. The turtle is armed with straws to imply that they are weapons against turtles because of how plastic straws break down into smaller pieces and eventually make their way into the ocean and lead to turtles suffocating from them. </h2>
