    <h2>My name is Norman Zhao and I am currently a student at CCSF majoring in animation. I took VMD 105 to gain an understanding animation so I am upset that I might not get a chance to due to the corona virus that is taking place. I am thankful for the opportunity to learn other basic visual media skills from photoshop to html and css. </h2>
