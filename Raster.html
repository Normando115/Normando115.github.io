        Title: "Playing" Outside
    Medium: Adobe Photoshop
    Dimensions: 500x333 pixels 
    
    <h2> My Concept for this was as a gamer, I don't spend a lot of time outside and spend most of my time indoors and something my parents often said to me as a kid was to play outside more. In this image, I am "playing" outside with my setup in a playground instead of indoors like its suppose to be played. </h2>
